152. Maximum Product Subarray
Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

For example, given the array [2,3,-2,4],
the contiguous subarray [2,3] has the largest product = 6.

modification of Kadaneâ€™s algorithm for largest sum

If we don't have negative values, it's obvious that we can just use Kadane's directly
i.e. define a variable localMax(i) to be the largest product up to i'th position
where localMax(i+1) = Max(localMax(i), num[i+1])
And we also keep a global largest value to be globalMax 

If we have the negative values, then we need to take care of the negative values as well
so we keep track of a minimum
